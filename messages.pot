msgid "Ergot is a serious fungal disease caused by <em>Claviceps purpurea</em> and related species. The fungus infects the flowers of cereals and grasses, replacing developing grains with dark, elongated structures called sclerotia. These sclerotia contain toxic alkaloids that pose significant risks to human and animal health."

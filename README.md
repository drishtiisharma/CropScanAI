## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
````



## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Python Virtual Environment

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Model (First-Time Setup Only)

If you don‚Äôt already have `pearl_millet_ergot_model.h5`, train the model:

```bash

```

This will:

* Train the CNN on the dataset
* Save the trained model as `pearl_millet_ergot_model.h5`

> If you already have this file, you can skip this step.



## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Model (Optional)

To verify the model works:

```bash
python test.py
```

> Ensure there‚Äôs a `test.jpg` image in your folder.
